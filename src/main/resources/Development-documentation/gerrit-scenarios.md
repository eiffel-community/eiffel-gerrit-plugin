## Create patch set - CASE1

Scenario overview:

This scenario describes a standard review cycle where a user uploads a patch
set, receives some comments, corrects the comments and submits the changes. The
plugin can find the SCS event from the previous successful review.

Preconditions:

- Previous review submitted to the master with hash `C0`
- The plugin sends SCS with id `E0`

The user does the following:

- Creates a branch
- Updates the code
- Squashes the commits to one commits (`C1`)
- Pushes to `refs/for/[branch name]` (`P1`)
- Receives comments from reviewer
- Updates the code
- Does `commit --amend` (`C2`)
- Pushes to `refs/for/[branch name]` (`P2`)
- Gets ok from the reviewer
- Hits the submit button in Gerrit

Eiffel events sent from the plugin:

- SCC(`E1`) sent for `P1` push with `BASE` link set to `E0`
- SCC(`E2`) sent for `P2` push with `PREVIOUS_VERSION` link set to `E1` and `BASE` link set to `E0`
- SCS(`E3`) at submit with `CHANGE` link set `E2` and `PREVIOUS_VERSION` link set to `E0`

Commit history after submit:

```git
* C2 Review changes
* C0 Commit from previous user
```

Trigger table:

| Event | Triggered by | Comment |
| ---   | ---          | ---     |
| E0    |              | Submit  |
| E1    | P1           |
| E2    | P2           |
| E3    |              | Submit  |

SCC Event table:

| Event | BASE | PREVIOUS_VERSION |
| ---   | ---  | ---              |
| E1    | E0   |
| E2    | E0   | E1               |

## Create patch set with rebase - CASE2

Scenario overview:

This scenario describes a workflow where a user performs a standard review
cycle. Before the review finishes another review finishes and submits to
master(`C01`).

Preconditions:

- Previous review submitted to the master with hash `C0`
- The plugin sends SCS with id `E0`

The user does the following:

- Creates a branch
- Updates the code
- Squashes the commits to one commits (`C1`)
- Pushes to `refs/for/[branch name]` (`P1`)
- Receives comments from reviewer
- Updates the code
- Does `commit --amend` (`C2`)
- Pushes to `refs/for/[branch name]` (`P2`)
- Gets ok from the reviewer
- Forced to rebase the code due to `C01` (`C3`)  event `E01`
- Pushes to `refs/for/[branch name]`  (`P3`)
- Hits the submit button in Gerrit

Eiffel events sent from the plugin:

- SCC(`E1`) sent for `P1` push with `BASE` link set to `E0`
- SCC(`E2`) sent for `P2` push with `PREVIOUS_VERSION` link set `E1` and `BASE` link set to `E0`
- SCC(`E3`) sent for `P3` push with `PREVIOUS_VERSION` link set `E2` and `BASE` link set to `E01`
- SCS(`E4`) sent at submit with `CHANGE` link set `E3` and `PREVIOUS_VERSION` link set to `E01`

Commit history after submit:

```git
* C3 Rebased changes
* C01 Other code change
* C0 Commit from previous user
```

Trigger table:

| Event | Triggered by | Comment |
| ---   | ---          | ---     |
| E0    |              | Submit  |
| E1    | P1           |
| E2    | P2           |
| E3    | P3           |
| E4    |              | Submit  |

SCC Event table:

| Event | BASE | PREVIOUS_VERSION |
| ---   | ---  | ---              |
| E1    | E0   |
| E2    | E0   | E1               |
| E3    | E01  | E2               |

## Create patch set, submitting with rebase strategy - CASE3

Scenario overview:

This scenario describes a workflow where a user performs a standard review
cycle. Before the review finishes another review finishes and submits to
master(`C01`). Due to project setting **Rebase if necessary** and no conflicting
changes, Gerrit will perform a rebase when the user submits the review.

Preconditions:

- Previous review submitted to the master with hash `C0`
- The plugin sends SCS with id `E0`

The user does the following:

- Creates a branch
- Updates the code
- Squashes the commits to one commits (`C1`)
- Pushes to `refs/for/[branch name]` (`P1`)
- Receives comments from reviewer
- Updates the code
- Does `commit --amend` (`C2`)
- Pushes to `refs/for/[branch name]` (`P2`)
- Gets ok from the reviewer
- Hits the submit button in Gerrit
- Gerrit will rebase (`C3`)

Eiffel events sent from the plugin:

- SCC(`E1`) sent for `P1` push with `BASE` link set to `E0`
- SCC(`E2`) sent for `P2` push with `PREVIOUS_VERSION` link set `E1` and `BASE` link set to `E0`
- SCS(`E3`) sent at submit with `CHANGE` link set `E2` and `PREVIOUS_VERSION` link set to `E01`

**Note:** Gerrit will create a new patchset and rebase in that patchset. The
plugin will not send an event for that patchset and we will not link to that
 patchset.

Commit history after submit:

```git
* C3 Rebased changes
* C01 Other code change
* C0 Commit from previous user
```

Trigger table:

| Event | Triggered by | Comment |
| ---   | ---          | ---     |
| E0    |              | Submit  |
| E1    | P1           |
| E2    | P2           |
| E3    |              | Submit  |

SCC Event table:

| Event | BASE | PREVIOUS_VERSION |
| ---   | ---  | ---              |
| E1    | E0   |
| E2    | E0   | E1               |

## Create patch set, submitting with merge strategy - CASE4

Scenario overview:

This scenario describes a workflow where a user performs a standard review
cycle. Due to project setting **Always merge** Gerrit will preform a merge when
the user submits the review.

Preconditions:

- Previous review submitted to the master with hash `C0`
- The plugin sends SCS with id `E0`

The user does the following:

- Creates a branch
- Updates the code
- Squashes the commits to one commits (`C1`)
- Pushes to `refs/for/[branch name]` (`P1`)
- Receives comments from reviewer
- Updates the code
- Does `commit --amend` (`C2`)
- Pushes to `refs/for/[branch name]` (`P2`)
- Gets ok from the reviewer
- Hits the submit button in Gerrit
- Gerrit creates a merge commit (`C3`)

Eiffel events sent from the plugin:

- SCC(`E1`) sent for `P1` push with `BASE` link set to `E0`
- SCC(`E2`) sent for `P2` push with `PREVIOUS_VERSION` link set `E1` and `BASE` link set to `E0`
- SCS(`E3`) sent at submit with `CHANGE` link set `E2`and `PREVIOUS_VERSION` set to `E0`

**NOTE:** The plugin will send a SCS event for the merge commit `C3` and not for
 the commit created in the patchset `C2`.

Commit history after submit:

```git
* C3 Merge commit
|\
| * C2  Review changes
|/
* C0 Commit from previous user
```

Trigger table:

| Event | Triggered by | Comment |
| ---   | ---          | ---     |

| E2    | P2           |
| E3    |              | Submit  |

SCC Event table:

| Event | BASE | PREVIOUS_VERSION |
| ---   | ---  | ---              |
| E1    | E0   |
| E2    | E0   | E1               |

## Create patch set with no previous events - CASE5

event from a previous review.

This scenario represents the situations:
- Plugin enabled for the first time
